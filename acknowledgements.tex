\noindent I would like to express my sincere thanks to my supervisors Dr.~Jacques Carette and Dr.~William Farmer for their continuous support to my learning journey.  Your expertise and feedback were invaluable in shaping this research direction and throughout my studies. 
I learned from you a lot about how to do research and communicate it. Many thanks for your help navigating graduate school. 
I am very thankful to Dr.~Wolfram Kahl and Dr.~Ridah Khedri for being on my supervisory committee. Your feedback, over the years, on this work is very appreciated. 

I am grateful to Dr.~Michael Kohlhase, Dr.~Florian Rabe, and members of the KWARC team for inviting me to their research group at FAU Erlangen. The collaboration between our teams has been a great source of inspiration for this work. 

Without the support of my family and friends, I wouldn't have been able to pursue this degree. Thanks for all the love and support. Thank you for always believing in me and encouraging me to explore different areas. 
I am most grateful to Ahmad, my husband, best friend and mentor. Thank you for always being there for me. I am so proud of the team we make.
