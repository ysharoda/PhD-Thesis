\chapter{Conclusion}
\label{ch:conclusion}

The fact that tog has no universes (Set : Set). that we couldn't find a better experimental language, and that this would not affect the generated constructions because we do not perform any reasoning and our code is backed by universal algebra, so we have a meta theory that tell us that we are not generating nonsense 

To do this within a system is extremely difficult, as it would require introspection and for theory
\emph{definitions} to be first-class citizens, which is not the case for any
system based on type-theory that we are aware of\ednote{still checking idris}. Untyped systems
in the Lisp tradition do this routinely, as does Maude~\cite{Maude}, which
is based on \emph{rewriting logic}; the downside is that there is no
difference between meaningful and meaningless transformations in these
systems, only between ``runs successfully'' and ``crashes''. However,
these constructions are fully typeable and, moreover, are not system-specific
(as they can be phrased meta-theoretically within Universal
Algebra), even though an implementation has to be aware of the syntactic
details of each system.
