\chapter{Constructions For Free!}



\section{Basic Ingredients}
equality, substitution, .. 

The theoretical background of our work is taken from Universal Algebra. 

Starting from theories of universal algebra, we aim to design a framework to generate useful constructions. To achieve this, our first step is to find a language to represent equational theories and other constructions, and a type checker to make sure the generated constructions are correct. While looking for this system we had the following criteria in mind 

\begin{itemize}
 \item A small language 
 \item Little syntactic sugar 
 \item Support record, data and function declarations 
 \item Dependently typed \ednote{we originally wanted a DTT-based system to be able to talk about the arrows. We didn't end up doing that - all work on the arrows is at the metalanguage (haskell), not the object one (tog). Now, there is no real reason why we need DTT. }
\end{itemize}

\ednote{Motivate the decision to use Tog}

To investigate what information can be derived from an equational theory, we needed to internalize it within a language and a type checker. One of our core decisions is to find a minimal

\section{Syntax}
Tog is a dependent type language that has a syntax similar to Agda, Coq and Idris, with much less sugar.
